<p>
Record Filter gives you the full power of ActiveRecord's query building tools with a
heaping helping of DSL thrown in to save your Ruby-loving fingers from that nasty SQL.
Which one of these looks better to you?
</p>

<pre><code>## Record Filter ##

Blog.filter do
  with(:created_at).greater_than(1.day.ago)
  having(:posts).with(:permalink, nil)
end

## ActiveRecord ##

Blog.find(
  :all,
  :joins => :posts,
  :conditions => ['posts.permalink IS NULL AND blogs.created_at > ?', 'blog-post', 1.day.ago)
</code></pre>

<p>In my browser, only one of them requires the use of a scrollbar to view the entire thing, and that's
all I need to know.</p>

<p>Record Filter supports all of the following SQL-stomping features:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Pure ruby API eliminates the need for hard-coded SQL in most cases.</li>
  <li>Works seamlessly with existing ActiveRecord APIs, including named scopes.</li>
  <li>Supports creation of ad-hoc filters as well as named filters that can be associated with object types.</li>
  <li>Allows chaining of filters with each other and with named scopes to create complex queries.</li>
  <li>Takes advantage of the associations in your ActiveRecord objects for a clean implicit join API.</li>
</ul>
