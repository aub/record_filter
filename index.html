<p>
Record Filter gives you the full power of ActiveRecord's query building tools with a
heaping helping of DSL thrown in to save your Ruby-loving fingers from writing nasty SQL.
Which one of these looks better to you?
</p>

{% highlight ruby %}
## Record Filter ##

Blog.filter do
  with(:created_at).greater_than(1.day.ago)
  having(:posts).with(:permalink, nil)
end

## ActiveRecord ##

Blog.find(
  :all,
  :joins => :posts,
  :conditions => ['posts.permalink IS NULL AND blogs.created_at > ?', 'blog-post', 1.day.ago)
{% endhighlight %}

<p>In my browser, only one of them requires the use of a scrollbar to view the entire thing, and that's
all I need to know.</p>

<p>Record Filter also supports named filters, which work much like named scopes and are even compatible
with them. The syntax for using named filters is exactly the same as for creating filters on the fly.</p>

{% highlight ruby %}
class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
  named_scope :with_nil_permalink, :conditions => ['permalink IS NULL']
  named_filter(:with_nil_content) { with(:content, nil) }
  named_filter(:created_recently) { with(:created_at).greater_than(1.day.ago) }
end

Post.created_recently.with_nil_permalink.with_nil_content
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Record Filter supports all of the following SQL-stomping features:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Pure ruby API eliminates the need for hard-coded SQL</li>
  <li>Works seamlessly with existing ActiveRecord APIs, including named scopes</li>
  <li>Supports creation of ad-hoc filters as well as named filters that can be associated with object types</li>
  <li>Allows chaining of filters and named filters with each other and with named scopes to create complex queries from simple building blocks</li>
  <li>Takes advantage of the associations in your ActiveRecord objects for a clean implicit join API</li>
  <li>100% does not silently throw away your joins like named_scopes do</li>
</ul>
