<p>If you're a Ruby programmer, you're probably proud of your beautiful code. 
If you use ActiveRecord, you've probably had a few moments of feeling dirty. Still, you've 
always felt dirty about putting it in your handsome Ruby code. You may even have a sneaking
suspicion that you shouldn't have to. Now you don't. If you prefer this:</p>

<pre><code>
Blog.filter do
  with(:created_at).greater_than(1.day.ago)
  having(:posts).with(:permalink, nil)
end
</code></pre>

<p>to this:</p>

<pre><code>
Blog.find(
  :all,
  :joins => :posts,
  :conditions => ['posts.permalink IS NULL AND blogs.created_at > ?', 'blog-post', 1.day.ago)
</code></pre>



<h2>Install</h2>

<pre><code>$ sudo gem install aub-record_filter --source=http://gems.github.com</code></pre>

<h2>Usage</h2>
