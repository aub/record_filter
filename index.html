<p>
You're a Ruby programmer. Sure, you get SQL, but you've found yourself feeling dirty 
when it starts touching your beautiful code. We're here to help.
</p>

<p>
Record Filter gives you the full power of ActiveRecord's query building tools with a
heaping helping of DSL thrown in to save your Ruby-loving fingers from that nasty SQL.
Which one of these looks better to you?
</p>

<pre><code>#### Record Filter ####
Blog.filter do
  with(:created_at).greater_than(1.day.ago)
  having(:posts).with(:permalink, nil)
end

#### ActiveRecord #####

Blog.find(
  :all,
  :joins => :posts,
  :conditions => ['posts.permalink IS NULL AND blogs.created_at > ?', 'blog-post', 1.day.ago)
</code></pre>

<p>In my browser, only one of them requires the use of a scrollbar to view the entire thing, and that's
all I need to know.</p>

<h2>Install</h2>
